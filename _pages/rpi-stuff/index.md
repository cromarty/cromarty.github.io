The `rpi-stuff` repository is my oldest github repository and it originally contained only things 
that related to the [Raspberry Pi][rpi], but now it contains things that will work on a desktop but 
relate to the Pi.

Most of note:

* imgtool

A script that can be used to:

* Create, partition and mount the partitions of an empty .img file
* Mount an existing .img file
* Mount the partitions of an SD card plugged into a Linux machine

Other stuff in here such as the `Sausage Machine` is older code and is just kept in here so I can 
reference how I did something once before.
