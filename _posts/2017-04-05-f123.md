I'm happy to be doing some work for [The F123 Project][f123].

Some of my text-to-speech code, including my alternative Emacspeak servers and my OpenMAX audio 
code for the [Raspberry Pi][rpi] will, hopefully be used in Linux images and ISO files produced by 
the project to enable access to Linux for their target audience, of disadvantaged and visually 
impaired users in the developing world.
