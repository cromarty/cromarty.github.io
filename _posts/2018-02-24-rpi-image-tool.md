I have completed the `rpi-image-tool` system.

This work replaces `imgtool` which was originally contained in my `rpi-stuff` repository.

The `rpi-image-tool` system is able to:

* Create a new and empty `.img` file containing the necessary small `FAT32` boot partition and the larger Linux partition.
* Mount the two partitions from an existing `.img` file, for example one downloaded ffrom the Web.
* Mount the two partitions contained on an `SD` card plugged into the host machine.

Note that the code assumes two partitions:

1. FAT32 `boot` partition.
* Linux `root` partition.

It assumes the partitions appear in that order.

See the documentation elsewhere on this site or grab the repository and install and read the help.
