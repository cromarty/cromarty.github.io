title: Alternative emacspeak Server Working

The alternative emacspeak server I'm writing is now working.

I started writing this a long time ago and it stagnated but now something is working.

There is `x86_64` code which uses the parser, and there is also code now for the Raspberry Pi, but 
work is still in beta.
